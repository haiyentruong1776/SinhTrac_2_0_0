  "hist1823": "– 1823: Dr. Jan Purkinje classified fingerprint patterns into several types.",
  "hist1893": "– 1893: Francis Galton (Charles Darwin's cousin) was the first to discover the role of fingerprints in heredity and racial differences. He simplified classification into 3 major types: Arches (no deltas), Loops (1 delta), and Whorls (2 deltas).",
  "hist1926": "– 1926: Dr. Harold Cummins, considered the father of fingerprint science, introduced the Pattern Intensity (PI) index theory. He discovered that fingerprints form simultaneously with brain structures in the fetus between weeks 13 and 19.",
  "hist1969": "– 1969: John J. Mulvihill, MD, and David W. Smith, MD, published 'The Genesis of Dermatoglyphics,' providing the latest version of fingerprint formation.",
  "hist1970": "– 1970: The Soviet Union used Dermatoglyphics to select candidates for the Olympic Games.",
  "hist1980": "– 1980: China conducted research on human potential, intelligence, and talent through fingerprints and genes.",
  "hist1985": "– 1985: Dr. Chen Yi Mou (Harvard) studied Dermatoglyphics based on Dr. Howard Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences.",
  "hist2004": "– 2004: The IBMBS center published over 7,000 theses on Dermatoglyphics. Today, many countries apply it to education to improve teaching quality.",
  "histToday": "– Today: The US, Japan, China, and Taiwan apply fingerprint science in education to enhance quality by applying different learning styles.",
